# About
Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it
and those who are not authorized cannot. Encryption keeps criminals and spies from stealing information.

I have used Fernet to encrypt my JWT token so that my web application would pass the encrypted
token through the internet without being accessed by anyone.

just do a special request to my social media pages:*
